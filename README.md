# Ball Box - Interactive Game

Ball Box is an interactive game where you control a ball. The objective is to avoid touching the box boundary and evade weapon projections to survive.

Live Demo: [Ball Box](https://sandeshshahapur.github.io/ball-box/))

This is my first game project built using TypeScript, and I hope you enjoy playing it. I had fun developing it, learning and figuring out how to implement various game mechanics since I did not want to use any external dependencies or libraries.

## Features

- **User Controls:**
  - Arrow keys or 'wsad' keys for desktop.
  - JoyStick controls for mobile or tablet devices.
- **Gameplay Mechanics:**
  - Avoid touching the box boundaries.
  - Evade weapon projections that increase ball size upon collision.
  - Smaller projections cause larger size increments.
- **Difficulty Adjustment:**
  - Adjustable difficulty levels via a slider.

## How to Run Locally

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ball_box.git
   cd ball_box
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Build the project:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. Start a local server (e.g., using `http-server` or any other server):

   ```bash
   npx http-server public
   ```

5. Open the game in your browser at `http://localhost:8080` (or the port your server specifies).
